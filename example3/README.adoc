Jib is one of the supported builders in Skaffold.
[Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) builds Docker and OCI images
for your Java applications and is available as plugins for Maven and Gradle.

The way you configure it in `skaffold.yaml` is the following build stanza:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta7
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: index.docker.io/siddhardhan/skaffold-jib #update to your repo
    jibMaven: {}
  local:
    push: true
----

###How to run
- Edit skaffold.yaml to update image details 
- Edit k8s/web.yaml to update image details 
- Set REGISTRY_USERNAME and REGISTRY_USERNAME environment variables to upload the images to your repository
[source, bash]
