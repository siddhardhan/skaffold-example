=== Example: Jib

Jib is one of the supported builders in Skaffold.
[Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) builds Docker and OCI images
for your Java applications and is available as plugins for Maven and Gradle.

The way you configure it in `skaffold.yaml` is the following build stanza:

[source,yaml]
----
build:
     artifacts:
     - image: gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold-example
       context: .
       jibMaven: {}
----

Please note that this example is for a standalone Maven project, where
all dependencies are resolved from outside. The Jib builder requires
that the projects are configured to use the Jib plugins for Maven or Gradle.
Multi-module builds require a bit additional configuration.
